desc: hit the front page at 50 requests per second for 30 minutes
xml:  xml/front_page_50_per_sec_for_30_mins.xml
gen:  ruby lib/wrap -xe full_load_test -l 5_per_sec_for_30_mins hit_landing_page_only > xml/front_page_50_per_sec_for_30_mins.xml

result:

The server responded to all requests for the first 770 seconds (~12 mins), with the response time gradually increasing from 200 
milliseconds to  1.2 seconds after running for 2 minutes, 4 seconds at 3 minutes, to almost a minute at 12 minutes into the test.

As the response time goes up, tsung reduces the number of requests per second from 50 per second for the first 3 minutes to 19 
or 20 per second after 15 minutes.  From 12 minutes onwards, the server wasn't really able to respond at all, and tsung was only 
sending 1 request every 10 seconds.
